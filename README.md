## 🔐 API Security

Security is essential to protect users, data, and platform functionality. This project implements several best-practice measures.

### 🛡️ Key Security Measures

- **Authentication (JWT)**: Validates user identity using secure tokens.  
- **Authorization (RBAC)**: Restricts access based on user role (guest or host).  
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks.  
- **Input Validation**: Blocks XSS, SQL injection, and invalid data.  
- **HTTPS**: Encrypts data during transfer for privacy and security.

### 🔒 Why Security Matters

- **User Data Protection**: Safeguards sensitive info like emails and passwords.  
- **Payment Security**: Secures financial transactions and payment data.  
- **System Integrity**: Prevents exploits, ensuring platform reliability.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** automates code testing, building, and deployment on every change, ensuring a faster and more reliable release process.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tests and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments.  
- **Docker Compose**: Manages multi-container development.  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** (Optional): Used for production deployment.

> With CI/CD, every code push automatically builds, tests, and deploys the latest version of the application — streamlining development and minimizing downtime.
